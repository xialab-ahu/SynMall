# ⭐⭐⭐ Welcome to SynMall ⭐⭐⭐ 

This is the README file for the feature pipeline of SynMall.

# A detailed field-wise user guide is available at https://bioinfo.ahu.edu.cn/synMall/#/guide. Please refer to it if you have any questions.

# Below is a brief introduction to the possible outputs (A-Z):

- .log and .log.lck file is generated each time and logs any errors if encountered.

- aiupred.output: Protein disorder prediction results from AIUPred. Lines starting with > indicate the mutation (>mutation_identifier;transcript_id;cds_pos;strand), followed by disorder scores for each residue.
- input_alt.fasta: Alternate FASTA file. Lines starting with > indicate the mutation; the sequence replaces the mutation site with the alternate allele. Since synonymous mutations do not change the translated amino acids, when using the protein feature section, only a `input_ref.fasta` will be generated.
- input_ref.fasta: Reference FASTA file. Lines starting with > indicate the mutation, followed by the nucleotide or amino acid sequence centered around the mutation site. If the index exceeds the boundary, it is padded with 'N' or 'X' to indicate unknown bases or residues.

- DanQ_task.tar: Features extracted from the pretrained DanQ model.
	- input_with_range.vcf: Input VCF file with an added range column.
	- input.bed: BED-format version of the input VCF.
	- input.fasta: DNA FASTA file generated from the BED input.
	- ref.fasta: Reference FASTA file without identifiers.
	- alt.fasta: Alternate FASTA file with the mutation site replaced by alternate allele.
	- DanQ_output.h5: Output HDF5 file from DanQ containing `feature_alt` and `feature_ref` datasets, shaped [sample_num, 919].

- DNA_Structure_Features_DNAshapeR.tar: Compressed results from DNAShapeR.
	- input.bed: BED-format input file from VCF.
	- bedtool_reference.fasta: Reference sequences retrieved via bedtools. Lines start with > indicating the genomic region.
	- bedtool_alternate.fasta: Same as above, but with the alternate allele at the mutation site.
	- *.EP: Electrostatic potential.
	- *.HelT: Helix twist.
	- *.ProT: Propeller twist.
	- *.MGW: Minor groove width.
	- *.Roll: Roll values.

- enformer_result.tar: Features extracted from the pretrained Enformer model.
	- 5313_Dim_All_Feature.tsv: Contains all 5313-dimensional features.
	- 20_Dim_PCA_Feature.tsv: Contains the top 20 principal components of the variant-effect scores provided by Enformer.

- GPMMSA_output.pth: Features extracted from the pretrained GPN-MSA model, shaped [sample_num, 128, 768].

- NetSurfP-3.0.tar: Compressed output from NetSurfP-3.0 for protein structural predictions.
	- 000*_folder/: Contains results for individual input records.
	- default_user: Summary results in .csv, tab-delimited .txt, and .json formats.
	- log.txt: Log file generated by NetSurfP-3.0.
	- summary.json: Summary file for this job.
- RNA_Structure_Features_RNAfold.tar: Compressed RNA secondary structure prediction results from RNAfold.
	- RNAfold.alt.out.fasta: Prediction for the alternate FASTA. Lines start with > for mutations, followed by sequence, dot-bracket notation, and minimum free energy.
	- RNAfold.ref.out.fasta: Prediction for the reference FASTA.

- Sequence_Features_ifeatureOmega.tar: Compressed sequence feature results from iFeatureOmega.
	- input.bed: [Only present when extracting DNA features] BED-format input from VCF.
	- bedtool_reference.fasta: [Only present for DNA features] Reference sequences from bedtools.
	- bedtool_alternate.fasta: [Only present for DNA features] Alternate allele versions of the sequences.
	- iFeatureOmega_DNA_alternate.txt: DNA sequence features for the alternate allele.
	- iFeatureOmega_DNA_reference.txt: DNA sequence features for the reference allele.
	- iFeatureOmega_RNA_alternate.txt: RNA sequence features for the alternate allele.
	- iFeatureOmega_RNA_reference.txt: RNA sequence features for the reference allele.
	- iFeatureOmega_Protein_reference.txt: Protein sequence features for the reference.
