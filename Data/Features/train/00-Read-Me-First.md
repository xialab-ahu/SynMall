# ⭐⭐⭐ Welcome to use SynMall ⭐⭐⭐ 
This is a README file for annotation pipeline in SynMall. 
# We provide a field-wise detail manual at https://bioinfo.ahu.edu.cn/synMall/#/guide. Please refer to that page if you have any questions. 
# About .log or .noResult file.
- .log file will generate every time, it will log error if you encounter any problems. 
- .noResult file isn't an error. It simply means that none of the input variants matched those in the dataset. This is normal for some small datasets. 
# Please feel free to contact us through synmall@foxmail.com, or from online https://bioinfo.ahu.edu.cn/synMall/#/upload Page.
